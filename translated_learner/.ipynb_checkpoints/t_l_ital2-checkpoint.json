    "TranslatedText": "Instead, outside the museums there are everywhere maps for tourists to communicate where they are with respect to the river and tourist places. But, these times everyone has an information-rich map at hand with smartphones. Without the blue dot on Google Maps indicating the location, it is unlikely that modern young people would know where they are and how to get to another place. That seems very sad to me. The first week here in Italy, I opened a printed map when I was disoriented and, with the help of monuments near me, I knew where I was. The other students thought that this way of navigating the city was strange, and they instead asked mobile phones for this information. It is dangerous that people are so addicted to the Internet to understand where they are, and besides this addiction reduces the beauty of a place.",

    "TranslatedText": "Maybe I have this passion for maps because I love going to the mountains, where maps are the most important resource after the water and there is always the chance to discover something new from add to the map. Sometimes I feel so important as Christopher Columbus or Ferdinand Magellan when I think I find a new cave or a small stream that isn't on the map yet. It is easy to understand the excitement that there was in Italy and, more generally, in Europe during the era of the discovery of the new world. Surely it was an honor to contribute essential information to the widespread image of the world in which we live.",

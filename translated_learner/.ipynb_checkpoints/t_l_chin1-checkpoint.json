    "TranslatedText": "Why use Chinese Pinyin when learning Chinese? The article mentions that Chinese education uses pinyin to teach students the pronunciation of Chinese characters, and that pinyin can help adults who don't speak Mandarin to learn the oral language, but I've heard Chinese people or foreigners who have learned to question the validity of the alphabet. When the reformists introduce Chinese pinyin, China is expected to become a modern and influential country, and the literacy of most of the population and the ability of foreigners to learn the country's language is the standard of two modern countries. I think it would be useful to have an ordinary Latinization system — better than different, harder to read Latino systems like Yale or Witoma — not to say that Chinese can probably pronounce Chinese names, places, and phrases.",

    "TranslatedText": "Here in Florence, it is typical that bookstores and shops of antiquity sell the maps of Italy and the world. Now, it is not easy to find an ordinary person with the competence of cartography such as Santucci or Pietro del Massaio, but still there are people who make maps. In Santo Spirito, there is a special shop called La Casa della Stampa di Sarubbi Lorenzo where the Lorenzo family works. They make the canvases and maps printed but also those made with watercolors, all handmade. In the shop, there are many beautiful maps of Italy, Tuscany, and the world. The daughter-in-law of Vincenzo Lorenzo, the founder of the store, showed me how he made a map of Sicily; with a stencil where there is the inverted map, she applied pressure with the ink to leave the 'Right image on paper.",

    "TranslatedText": "This research made me think about the depth of hiking. The other day, I entered the Church of Santa Maria Magdalene dei Pazzi, where there was an exhibition on the Camino de Santiago and the pilgrimages more generally. Inside the church, there were many photos that struck those people who made the way. Organized in groups according to the nation where they were taken, the photos showed religious monuments along the way, such as crosses and some shrines dedicated to Our Lady, but also extraordinary moments of experience, such as the sunset or the silhouettes of the companions in the fog. It struck me that if I asked those people to create a map of the pilgrimage, they would mark their path with those religious details, while I would draw a path defined with geographical characteristics.",

    "TranslatedText": "But even if it is Chinese or foreigner, it may be more effective for formal learning of Chinese useless Roman words. Foreigners who speak English, French, and German look at Chinese pinyin often rely on the pronunciation of the alphabet and accidentally say many wrong words. Pinyin looks easier to read than Chinese characters so focus on looking at the Chinese characters it can distraction you. For flower people, pinyin letters have nothing to do with Chinese characters. Chinese Pinyin borrowed the tone of the phonetic letters, why not use the phonetic? Even if I haven't learned the phonetic letters so I haven't personally experienced its shortcomings, its benefits look much more than the bad ones. The basic pinyin of Chinese is a Latinization system created by foreign scholars, and phonetic is created by chemists. There may not be a phonetic alphabet system that avoids the difficulty of clearly representing the pronunciation and meaning of Chinese at the same time.",

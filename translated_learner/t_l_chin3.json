    "TranslatedText": "I just moved from California to Massachusetts at the age of 12 and didn't feel as interesting as the scenery and monuments of Massachusetts, and I wanted California at that time. But on a cold autumn evening, my mom said to me, “How are you not happy? You are home every weekend. “Let's go out and explore the features of this place,” so she asked me to accompany her to the repair hall to see a dance show. I didn't want to go but there's no way, but I got curious to get to the repair hall. I haven't been in that luxurious place, and I feel comfortable seeing a few familiar faces in the audience. My mom, I, and a couple of classrooms were sitting together to watch a super gorgeous, super dynamic dance show. The dance on stage looks to be praising heroes and angels. I changed my view of the city that night, after which I would be excited to go to the city to enjoy all the fun in my city.",

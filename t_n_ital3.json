    "TranslatedText": "The Minister of Regional Affairs Mariastella Gelmini also spoke on the question of the presence in school and duration of curfew: “The fact that in the text of the decree just launched was not reprogrammed the curfew — he said during the recording of the TV episode “Iceberg” — does not mean that it will last until July 31. This is a distorted reading of the measure. I am absolutely sure that soon the curfew will be just a bad memory. It is the same decree to say, specifying that the Council of Ministers will be able to intervene in the coming weeks, with periodic coupons to the dl, modifying both the rules for reopening and the times of curfew”.",

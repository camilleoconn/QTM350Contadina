    "TranslatedText": "The second floor has a small column in the middle of each window and a small arch on the third floor with five huge windows and five pairs of stone pillars supporting a roof like a Roman or a Greek temple. Look at the side and back of the repair hall and you'll think you're looking at another building because it doesn't have a granite building on the front. The back door is relatively modern, with uneven glass roofs and large windows connected together. The repair hall is one of the best concert halls in North America. Its interiors are palatial, including a high painted ceiling with portraits of the most respectable statesmen in American history on four walls. Many say that the sound quality there is the best they hear in their lifetime.",

The world's largest ocean-going cruise departs from Southampton, England, to New York, USA, mostly wealthy and immigrants from other parts of Europe. But no one thought that five days after sail, it hit the iceberg at night and the hull entered the water, split in half and sank the seabed in less than three hours. Driven by curiosity, Luo Fei's team began preparing for the Six since 2012 and gathered more than 20 historical and sociological scholars to set up research groups to find the whereabouts of these Chinese survivors. Titanic director Cameron was the producer of this film. According to the boarding records, eight Chinese were third-class passengers, the same class as the movie actor Jack. On a ticket number 1601 they have handwritten names: Fang Lang, Lee Bing, Chang Chip, Ah Lam, Ling Hee, Hu Zhong, Len Lam, Len Lam, Li Lin Ling, transliteration).

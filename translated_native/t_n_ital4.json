    "TranslatedText": "“For two months I have been waiting together with Constance, Darius's mother, to be able to give the last greeting to our son, but we can not even access the deposit of the cemetery of Prima Porta, where are stacked his ashes.

And the Covid emergency is a justification that is only exploited to justify itself”.",

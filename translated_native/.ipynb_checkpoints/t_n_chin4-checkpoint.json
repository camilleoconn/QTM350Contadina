    "TranslatedText": "COP26 will provide participants with the first opportunity to review and assess progress made so far since the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 and to summarize the lessons of failure. This agreement, also known as the Paris Agreement, is, in general, a strategic plan for humanity to avoid a climate disaster. The premise of this programme is based on the understanding that if global warming continues and temperatures rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, many irreversible and catastrophic changes will occur on the planet. Needless to say, a good plan, if it cannot be implemented, is also a dead word. In order to ensure that the terms of the agreement are effectively complied with, the commitments are put into practice, provision is made for an annual meeting, such as the project team's work, to be held regularly to discuss specific issues such as their operational strategies, progress, obstacles, difficulties and small goals.",

    "TranslatedText": "I chose this photo of the Jeronimos Monastery in Lisbon because it is wonderful and shows it so important is the architecture and aesthetic elements in the construction of religious buildings. As we have mentioned before, architecture always tells a story about the time when something was built, including religious movements, knowledge of the time, and many more social and economic aspects of the region. In this photo you can see the Manueline style, a style that emerged at the end of the 16th century and at the beginning of the 17th century by Manuel I of Portugal, and the Gothic style. Manuel I wanted to dedicate the monastery to the wealth and luxury that Henry the Navigator won during his expeditions to India.",

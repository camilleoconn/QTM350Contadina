    "TranslatedText": "The British government shrinks entry controls as the coronavirus outbreak worsens in India. From Friday (April 23), most travelers who have visited India in the past 10 days will be refused entry into the UK. A person holding a British or Irish passport or a person with UK abode may enter the UK but must be separated for ten days in a government-approved hotel. Mark Walport, former UK chief scientific adviser, told the BBC that the British government's decision was a little too late. He argues that the new variant is more contagious and the government has good reason to reject it outside the UK. The country's health department said the UK has detected more than 100 cases of variants found in India. From Tuesday (April 20), Hong Kong has banned the landing of civil aviation aircraft from India, Pakistan and the Philippines for a period of 14 days. The Hong Kong government classified the three countries as high-risk areas. At least 53 passengers tested positive for COVID-19 on April 4 on a Tassin Airlines flight from New Delhi to Hong Kong, India, AFP reports.",

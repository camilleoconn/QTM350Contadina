    "TranslatedText": "The Lorenzo family comes from the Alfani, an old family rich in Florence. Family money was sold out before Vincent, so he opened La Casa della Stampa in 1978 with the intention of printing ancient books. Instead of just printing books, he learned how to make paintings and maps. Now the store has become the family business, but the work is not too easy. Craftsmen are diligent and creative, but it is difficult for them to receive payment so regularly. Initially, Vincenzo's brother worked together with him, but he became tired of this slow work and then went away to do another job in the United States.",

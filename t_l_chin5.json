    "TranslatedText": "I think the author of this article used Tara Westover to escape her survivist Mormon family to metaphor her own educational background and change of vision, because the Mormon religion, though extremely conservative, is still a kind of Christian rise in the United States, but Americans don't know much about the history of Mormon. Or Mormon vision. My experience is that we talk about Mormon, a lot of people make a joke about polygamy, and describe the Mormon as crazy. If I was a Mormon, I would mind if I heard them. This is not to say that I agree with the Mormon values, and indeed that one's natural reaction to other people who attack their beliefs is to hate them and do not care for their criticism. Americans persuade them for persuasion that they will not criticize Mormons or Chinese so profoundly.",
